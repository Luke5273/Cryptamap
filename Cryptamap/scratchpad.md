# Bugs to fix

# Currently working on
- Add grid overlay
- Refactor rendering to own file
- Make view class, and move all rendering to that

# Next on the list
- Nagivation using mouse not just keyboard
	- Preferably using imgui/io not glfw callbacks
	- Done with imgui io, actually much easier this way

# Further roadmap and feature ideas
